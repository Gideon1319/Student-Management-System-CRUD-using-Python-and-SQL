📢✨ Student Management System (CRUD) using Python and SQL
🚀 Project Highlight: Student Management System (CRUD) — Python & SQL

        I recently completed a console-based Student Management System project using Python and SQLite as part of my ongoing effort to deepen my understanding of database-driven applications and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

📌 Project Overview:
        A simple yet functional application that allows users to manage student records directly from the command line interface. This system demonstrates how Python can interact with an SQL database to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently.

🗂️ Key Features:
      ✅ Add New Student Records — insert student details like name, age, and course.
      ✅ View All Students — display a list of all stored student records.
      ✅ Search Student by ID — quickly locate a student’s details using their unique ID.
      ✅ Update Existing Records — modify student information as needed.
      ✅ Delete Student Records — remove entries from the database securely.

✅ Tools & Skills: Python | SQLite | SQL Queries | CRUD Operations | CLI Applications | Database Management
